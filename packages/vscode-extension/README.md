SuiteCloud Extension for Visual Studio Code is part of the SuiteCloud Software Development Kit (SuiteCloud SDK), a set of tools to customize your NetSuite accounts. SuiteCloud Extension for Visual Studio Code allows you to customize your SuiteCloud projects for NetSuite. The available SuiteCloud projects include **SuiteApp projects** — self-contained, standalone projects that you can publish in the SuiteApp Marketplace for other users to download and install, and **Account Customization Projects** — intended for customizations on accounts you own, such as your production, development, and sandbox accounts.
